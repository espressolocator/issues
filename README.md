# telescope-espressolocator

The package provides EspressoLocator web application for coffee lovers. It is
designed to be used in conjunction with moderately customised Telescope
framework (evolved into [VulcanJS](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/index.html) since 2016).

For more details on EspressoLocator please refer to its [FAQ](https://espressolocator.com/page/faq).

## Contribute

The best way to contribute is to submit new coffee places to the app, it takes
less than a minute, we do not bother users with lengthy forms and
questionaires.

If you are developer, contributed code is more than welcome. Please get in
touch if you have an idea of the feature you want to work on.

The higer priority task at the moment is refactoring all functionality to
VulcanJS, which is React and GraphQL/Apollo framework for Meteor. VulcanJS is
designed in a way that each layer is independent, therefore developer has more
freedom in terms of choosing the components or moving away altogether to the
different stack. VulcanJS is an evolution of TelescopeJS that this package is
using.
